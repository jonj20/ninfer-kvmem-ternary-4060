#pragma once
// The Engine core of a DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash (DeepseekV41ForCausalLM) artifact. The model family has
// its own load and execution (models/deepseek_v41) and serves prompts through the shared frontend
// in its DeepSeek dialect. Its Engram rows are read from the table's files (or RAM) for each pass.
//
// Up to max_concurrency requests run at once, each on its own executor sequence, admitted in FIFO
// order. A prompt is prefilled in chunks, one request at a time; between its chunks every decoding
// request advances one token, all of them in one batched pass. With the context cache on, a
// sequence keeps its state when its request ends, and a snapshot of its window rings and compressor tails where
// the prompt's last user turn closes: a later prompt that starts with what the sequence holds, or
// with the prompt up to that point, resumes there instead of prefilling it again. What a sequence
// holds before another request takes it, and its state at the end of a prompt's shared prefixes
// (the leading system messages and tool declarations, a declared cache boundary), go to images in
// pinned host memory within --host-cache-mib; a prompt on any sequence resumes from the longest
// image it starts with, including one stored while it waited for its first prompt chunk.
//
// With --lookup-ngram, a request whose last tokens appeared earlier in its sequence verifies what
// followed them then (up to --draft-tokens) after its next token in one pass; the acceptance keeps
// drafts while they equal the request's own keyed draw, so the output is plain decoding's.
